#All of Betty's recipes call for milk, eggs, sugar, flour, and butter. For example, her cupcake recipe calls for:

#Flour	Sugar	Eggs	Milk	Butter
#2 cups	0.75 cups	2 eggs	1 cups	0.5 cups

#Create a NumPy array that represents this data. Each element should be a number (i.e., 2 for "2 cups"). Save this array as cupcakes.
cupcakes = np.array([2, 0.75, 2, 1, 0.5])

#Betty's assistant has compiled all of her recipes into a csv (comma-separated variable) file called recipes.csv. Load this file into a variable called recipes.

#Display recipes using print.
#Each row represents a different recipe. Each column represents a different ingredient.

#Recipe	Cups of Flour	Cups of Sugar	Eggs	Cups of Milk	Cups of Butter
#Cupcakes	...	...	...	...	...
#Pancake	...	...	...	...	...
#Cookie	...	...	...	...	...
#Bread	...	...	...	...	...

#The 3rd column represents the number of eggs that each recipe needs.
#Select all elements from the 3rd column and save them to the variable eggs.

#Which recipes require exactly 1 egg? Use a logical statement to get True or False for each value of eggs.

#Betty is going to make 2 batches of cupcakes (1st row) and 1 batch of cookies (3rd row).
#You already have a variable for cupcakes. Create a variable for cookies with the data from the 3rd row.

#Get the number of ingredients for a double batch of cupcakes by using multiplication on cupcakes. Save your new variable to double_batch.
double_batch = recipes[0,:] * 2
